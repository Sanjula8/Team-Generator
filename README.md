Starting this application will prompt the user for information about their software managing team. The user will be prompted to enter information about the team manager and then information about additioanl team members - choosing between a mix of engineers and interns.

Using Inquirer, teh user will be asked for the email, id and other specific information for their team members based on the role within the company.

This application will then gather information about each employee and render a uniquely generated HTML page, displaying the team's basic information with quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

In additiona, this application has been tested with to ensure all parts are functional.
